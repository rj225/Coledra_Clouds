# Coledra_Clouds
As an intern at Coledra Clouds, I undertook the responsibility of a project named "Coledra Clouds" using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.To achieve a modern and professional look, I utilized HTML and CSS to implement intuitive user interface and Bootstrap was employed to ensure a mobile-friendly and responsive design.
