# Coledra_Clouds
As an intern at Coledra Clouds, I undertook the responsibility of a project named "Coledra Clouds" using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The project aimed to enhance the website's overall design, user experience, and functionality.



To achieve a modern and professional look, I utilized HTML and CSS to implement intuitive user interface and Bootstrap was employed to ensure a mobile-friendly and responsive design,.

In addition, I leveraged jQuery to incorporate interactive elements and dynamic features into the website. This included smooth transitions, animated sliders, and modal pop-ups to engage users and highlight key information.

By completing this internship project, it allowed me to further develop my skills in front-end web development, while also gaining valuable experience working in a professional environment.
